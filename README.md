## 🏛️ Service Architecture Details

### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. Authentication Service → Validates credentials, issues JWT
2. JWT Contains → User ID, role, basic permissions  
3. Each Service → Validates JWT via Administration Service
4. Administration Service → Central authority for user/role/permission data
```

### **Service Dependencies**
```
Authentication Service (No dependencies)
    ↓
Administration Service (Admin-only user/role management)
    ↓  
Business Services (Customer, Equipment, Expenses)
    ↓
Inventory Service (Core business logic)
    ↓
Promotions Service (Advanced business logic)
    ↓
Orders Service (Complex integrations)
    ↓
Waste Service (Analytics)
```

## 🔐 Security & Authorization

### **Authentication Service**
- **Purpose**: Security & session management only
- **Functions**: Login/logout, JWT tokens, password validation
- **Integration**: Calls Administration Service for user data

### **Administration Service** 
- **Purpose**: User/role/permission management (Admin only)
- **Authorization**: Requires admin permissions for ALL operations
- **Functions**: User CRUD, role management, system configuration

### **Permission Model**
- **Format**: `Entity-Action` (e.g., "Ingredients-Create")
- **Validation**: Each service validates permissions via Administration Service
- **Roles**: Admin (full access), Employee (limited access)
